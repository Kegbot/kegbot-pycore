# Publishes built images to the docker hub.
#
#   - Merges to master are published as `kegbot/pycore:master` as
#     well as `kegbot/pycore:sha-<shortsha>`.
#   - Releases are published as `kegbot/pycore:latest` as well as
#     `kegbot/pycore:<tag>`
#
# Right now we prefer Docker Hub instead of GitHub Package Registry
# because GitHub requires login even for public repo pulls, and that's
# more work for the average user. Change to the following `with:`
# settings to use GitHub Package index:
#
#   username: $GITHUB_ACTOR
#   password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
#   registry: docker.pkg.github.com
#   repository: kegbot/kegbot-pycore/kegbot-pycore
